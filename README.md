# learn-go

A collection of resources and practices that I used for learning Go during the hack week 20

## Tutorials and Practices

- [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide)
    - the code and diagrams from the instructor: https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts

- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

- [Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)

## Interesting readings

- project layout: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
- Go Slices: usage and internals: https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro
    - Note: Rather than trying to go over all example at once, I'd use it as a reference for code snippets
